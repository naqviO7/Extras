We cannot apply standard search on BST.
In Bst first we have to look in root and then in child.
Searching is Complex in BST.
Reason Array Will be Better:
If we made array of 10 then it will be easy and fast to look for record.
Its time complexity decreases because we have to serach from one index to specific index by incrementing.
Time Complextity will be Big O(1).
