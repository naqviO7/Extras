Algorthim For Bitwise AND OR XOR and NOT Operation

Steps:
-> input integer 1
-> intput integer 2
-> perform datatype check
-> if both are integers execution continue 
	-> else quit prgram
-> convert both numbers to binary to perfrom bitwise operation
-> code functions for each bitwise operation
-> call each fucntion onthe basis of operation you want to perfrom
